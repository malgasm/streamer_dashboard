* TODO *
[*] implement audio file tags, e.g. vol0_5.labelLol.originalfilename.mp3

[*] add "exact" text matcher for commands
[*] command for command suggestions, or other suggestions
[*] host all of the assets on a server somewhere
  [*] could write a manifest to source the assets from a local server for now and then later move them to s3 or whatevs
